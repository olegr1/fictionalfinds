# About this demo (WORK IN PROGRESS!)

Iâ€™m building a fictional online store using a public dummy REST API from [https://dummyjson.com/docs/products](https://dummyjson.com/docs/products) whenever I have free time.

### Some of its features I want to implement (none are complete at the moment):

- Responsive mobile-first layout
- Custom CSS
- Screen reader friendly
- Fully accessible
- Requests handled by TanStack Query (React Query)
- Routing handled by React Router
- State management via URL parameters
